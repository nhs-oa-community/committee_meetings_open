## **Committee meeting discussion and/or actions:** 


1. It is important for the NHS-Open Analytics Community Committee to find and agree a way to combine both the NHS-R Community and NHS Python Community whilst ensuring viability.  It was agreed that this will include, where possible, the continued hosting of workshops, webinars, training, hack-a-thons blogs and online resources such as code, books, training materials, etc. Some committee members volunteered to act as leads for elements of community work. There were as follows:
- Daniel Weiand, Rosemary Walmsley and Janarth Duraisingham volunteered to assist with the co-ordination of training related activities.
- Daniel Weiand volunteered to help with conference organisation
- Tom Jemmett and Sammi Rosser offered to help get the new NHS_OA website up and running.

   
2. Final logo designs for the NHS-Open Analytics Community have been put to committee members via vote.
   
3. Potential community strap lines were discussed and whether the focus should be the aim of the community and desired outcome/s of its activities, such as ‘driving patient care through data’, or whether it should be who we are as a community was debated. It was queried whether the inclusion of references to the NHS and/or Health and Care in the strap line and/or branding would unintentionally exclude employees of other key areas, such as government bodies and social care, from the community. On the other hand, maintaining reference to the NHS and Health and Care in the branding would provide clarity to the purpose and target audience of the community whilst, in turn, ensuring that NHS-OA remains linked to the Goldacre review and its acknowledgement of the NHS-R Community. 

   Final proposal: “A community for promoting open code and tools in Health and Care”
   
4. Clear and concise attendance guidelines/criteria for workshops, webinars and Coffee and Code sessions are to be published on the NHS-R Way Book (which will be renamed and updated in due course), sign-up forms and website. The exact criteria are to be reviewed and finalised separately to this committee meeting by Claire Welsh, Chris Beeley and Caileigh Solomenca.

   
5. Claire Welsh requested assistance with the transfer of content and functionality from the current NHS-R Community website to the new NHS-Open Analytics Community website. Tom Jemmett and Sammi Rosser volunteered to help. 
   
6. It was proposed that, under the umbrella of the NHS-Open Analytics Community, an additional community and committee are created for Reproducible Analytical Pipelines (RAP). This would offer a separate space to co-ordinate and create training resources, code, case studies, etc. focused on the development and promotion of RAP. It is hoped that input will be received from multiple organisations, sharing the workload and increasing the long-term viability of the community.  The committee meetings will be held regularly, possibly monthly, with the first meeting scheduled for late January 2026. Joseph Wilson, Sammi Rosser, Janarth Duraisingham and Claire Welsh expressed interest in being part of the community and committee.
   
7. Regular 1-hour committee meetings will be held monthly and, where possible, at the same time and day of the week. The next NHS-Open analytics Community Committee meeting is scheduled for Tuesday 24th February 2026.
